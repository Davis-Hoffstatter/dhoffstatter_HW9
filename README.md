Homework 9 , Web Forms

a. The goal of this project is to make a easy to navigate web form with basic styling to appeal to users

b. Throughout this assignment I used multiple best practices for forms. To start, I have 4 pages that all link together as you progress from the index. My index includes a brief description as to what is occuring so the user understands. Page 1 collects basic information from the student with autofocus on so its easy to navigate and convenient. Aside from this, I included code for each and every state as well as required fields so the user can easily input where they are from. Page 1 links to Page 2 where I collect information on the stuent such as what year they are in school and what their major within TCOB is. Following this the user is navigated to a thank you page with a image. 

I believe this form is very simple and collects basic information taking only 1 minute to complete so the user is not overwhelmed with questions. 

c. As stated above, my form provdes user accessibility in multiple ways. The first would be a tooltip icon that the user can click into to further describe what they are answering and assist them throughout the process. The next would be autofocus where a cursor automatically jumps to the first line so they are ready to answer. Aside from this the site is easy to navigate and simple.
